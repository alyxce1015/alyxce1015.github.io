### CPSC 120

* Lab 8

    In Lab 8 part 1, I enjoyed creating loops to create a
    printed message. I learned how to create loops that 
    end by subtracting the count. I also enjoyed making
    math functions and writing out pseudo code.

* Lab 9

    In lab 9 part 1, this lab was fun because we got to
    make a word generator using different files.
    It was enjoyable to use these files for the
    computer to print out specific words from each
    file. I also learned how to add elements to
    vectors.

* Lab 10

    Part 1 in lab 10 was fun because we go to program
    math functions to calculate the area of a rectangle.
    I learned how to make these functions for the computer
    to test. I enjoyed its simplicity.
